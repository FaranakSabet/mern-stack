# Create React Express App

In this repository, you'll find a new React-based Google Books Search app. In this app, I created a React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. Here is  also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
